# PortaLinux Markup Language
The PortaLinux Markup Language, or PLML for short, is a very simple markup
language based on Tom's Obvious Markup Language or TOML for short. PLML is
basically a subset of TOML, meaning that any valid PLML is valid TOML and can
be parsed by a TOML parser library. `libplml` is a reference implementation of
PLML, but the PLML Standard document will be posted up on Wednesday 17:30 CST
in `pocketlinux32/pocketlinux32`, so you can write your own implementation of
the parser once that gets posted
